Mart WebApp
Mart WebApp is an e-commerce web application designed to offer a smooth and efficient online shopping experience for customers, along with robust management features for admins. Built with .NET, SQL Server, and a front-end stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application allows for streamlined product browsing, order management, and cart functionalities.

Key Features
Customer Side
Product Catalog: Users can browse an extensive catalog of products, each accompanied by essential details like name, price, description, and images.
Detailed Product View: Customers can view each product’s specific details on its individual page, allowing them to make informed purchase decisions.
Cart Management: Customers can add selected products to their cart and view a cart summary at any time, which provides a quick glance at the selected items and their total price.
Order Placement: After reviewing items in the cart, customers can place orders directly through the web app. Upon successful order placement, a confirmation popup is displayed to assure the customer of their purchase.
Admin Side
Product CRUD Operations: Admins have complete control over the product catalog with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, enabling them to manage the available products and their details effortlessly.
Order Management: Admins can view new orders with an initial “Pending” status. Once an order is processed, they can update it to “Delivered,” moving it to the completed orders list.
Image Management: A dedicated folder and database table are used to store and manage product images, making it easy for admins to add, update, or delete images associated with each product.
Technology Stack
Backend: .NET Core with C#
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: SQL Server
Configuration: Program.cs for application settings (instead of a traditional Startup.cs file)
Future Enhancements
To enhance functionality, the app is set to integrate user authentication with the Identity framework, allowing for role-based access control. Additional features like advanced product filtering, search options, and sorting functionalities will further improve the user experience, offering more tailored product discovery.
